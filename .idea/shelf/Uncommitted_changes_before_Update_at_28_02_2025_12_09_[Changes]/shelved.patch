-
-Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for

-of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
-works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
-and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
-These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
-culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
-works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
-part through the use and efforts of others.
-
-For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
-expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
-associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
-is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
-elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
-terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
-Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

-protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
-Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
-limited to, the following:

-     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
